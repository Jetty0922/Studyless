Biology - Cell Structure and Function

Cell Membrane:
The cell membrane is a selectively permeable barrier that controls what enters and exits the cell. It consists of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins.

Mitochondria:
Often called the "powerhouse of the cell," mitochondria produce ATP through cellular respiration. They have their own DNA and double membrane structure.

Photosynthesis:
Process: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂
Occurs in chloroplasts of plant cells. Light-dependent reactions occur in thylakoids, while the Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma.

Osmosis:
The movement of water molecules across a selectively permeable membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to higher solute concentration. This is a passive transport process.

DNA Replication:
The process by which DNA makes a copy of itself during cell division. It is semiconservative, meaning each new DNA molecule contains one original strand and one new strand.
