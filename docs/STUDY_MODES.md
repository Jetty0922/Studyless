# Study Modes Explained

## Test Prep Mode

Best for: Exams, certifications, interviews — anything with a specific date.

### How It Works

Set your test date, and we schedule your reviews to maximize what you'll remember on exam day.

### The 3-Phase System

**1. Maintenance** (30+ days out)
- Relaxed schedule with longer intervals
- Focus on getting familiar with all the material

**2. Consolidation** (7-30 days out)
- Intervals gradually shorten as your test approaches
- Weak cards get extra attention to build memory strength

**3. Cram** (final week)
- Intensive daily reviews
- Cards prioritized by what you're most likely to forget on test day

### Exam Day

Only shows cards you're struggling with for a quick final review.

### After Your Test

Convert the deck to Long Term mode to keep learning, or archive it.

## Long Term Mode

Best for: Languages, professional knowledge, anything you want to remember long-term.

### How It Works

Powered by **FSRS** (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) — the same algorithm used by Anki and backed by memory research.

### The Core Idea

Your brain forgets things over time in a predictable way. We schedule reviews right before you'd forget, so you remember more with less effort.

### Features

- **New cards** start with short intervals (1-4 days)
- **Easy cards** grow to longer intervals (weeks → months)
- **Hard cards** stay at shorter intervals until you master them
- **Each card adapts** — the app tracks what's difficult for you

### The Result

~90% retention with the minimum number of reviews. You spend time only on cards that need it.
